# [Project Titans](https://github.com/Broadcom/cloud-tools-titans)
# Enable Service Mesh On SaaS Natively Without Sweating

## Value Proposition 
- ### Service Mesh has become the de facto layer for SaaS Platform
- ### Cost Saving
  - #### Reduce the developemnt cost of common functionalites
  - #### Reduce the operational cost of running a Control Plane
  - #### Reduce the learning curve barrier to adoption of the service mesh
- ### Managed Security, Visibility and Stability
  - #### End-to-end encryption with auto TLS cert management
  - #### TLS with FIPS 140-2 compliance
  - #### App's REST API protection with simple configuration
  - #### Configurable App API's operational metrics
  - #### Advanced error handling and global ratelimiting 
- ### Developer friendly 
  - #### Use familiar Helm deployment tool
  - #### Use kubernetes as the control plane
  - #### Configure desired features in the your own App's Helm Chart

## Implementation
> The entire titans solution is delivered using a single helm libary chart to be included into your app's helm chart
